        <ul>
            <li> I am interested in accessibility because it <em>improves</em> access to information for those with and without disabilities </li>
            <li> Although my focus isn't on front-end, I believe it is still important to understand what makes an accessible website design </li>
            <li> I also want my future documents to be accessible so that others can more easily understand the information in them </li>
